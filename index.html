                        I moved to Boston MA 1995, that was my first time flew out of country. It was though decision for me, because I had to leave my mother and siblings back home. My cousin who picked me up from Boston Logan Airport. 
                        It was a big culture shock for me. I had very hard time understanding American accent although I had two English subject starting from first grade to collage.
                        I didn’t know how to cook any kind of food, back in Bangladesh we had people they cook and clean for my family.
